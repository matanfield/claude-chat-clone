This is a product specification document for this project, called Rather (rather.so) (currently top folder is Claude-clone). 


Rather.so is an app for deep exploration of any given topic, and particularly for creative purposes, whether specififying, designing and building an app, preparing a course, or conducting research. Rather allows you to fork and break a conversation into many different paths, and to explore each path in depth with a splitting conversation. Within every conversation the app maintains its bottom line, outcome, or conversation summary.  

Rather elements include Users, users have Projects, Projects have Chats in them, but Chatsa also spin-off other Chats, with initializing Head, where a regular Chat Head is the first message of the Chat, and a Chat can spin-off another Chat by having its Head taken from that Chat, being the whole chat (i.e. a fork), a section, sentence or even a wors in that Chat. So in addition to having many Chats within a Project, Chats may also have a Parent Chat and a corresponding Head (being an element or part of that Chat). Chat themselves have messages, my messages and the AI messages (we may add later others to have collaborative conversations with AI). Every Chat also has an Outcome, the outcome of the chat fullfilling its purpose; it can be a document, code or an image, but we can start with making it a text document (that may also be rendered as image if that text is a frontend code). It's similar to Claude's Artifacts, but the purpose of it here is to be the final result the conversation. Each chat retain the history of Outcomes. The Outcomes of Sub Chats is integrated into the Outcome of their Parent Chat. 

Regarding the Database, we'll have Users, Projects, Chats (including Parent and Subs), Chat Heads, Messages and Outcomes organized in the proper tables and proper relations. We may add more structure later. We'll be using Supabase's Postgres database and Supabase's Auth for the database and authentication.
